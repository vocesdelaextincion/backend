# Directives

## Intro

This is the main file with the directives that will work as kickstart for the test flows
This project, this entire project must have tests, unit tests.
Those tests will simulate a real user flow. Or the most similar approach possible.

## 1st step

- No code for this step.
- Let's discuss and bring some ideas on how can we create a robust, modern and minimalist test suite that works.
- Please check the tech stack in package.json file.

## 2nd step

- Let's start with the unit tests
- Install what you need (jest and related)
- Check all the auth routes and create tests for them
